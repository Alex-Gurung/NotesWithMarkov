# NotesWithMarkov
Note taking application that pulls wikipedia articles and uses Markov Chains to generate suggestions (Idea from https://github.com/laudiacay/noteorious)
Not meant to be original, but as an initial project to use Electron.
## Status
Very early in development, but can pull websites from Wikipedia on button click and create Markov-Chain (although slowly), and has an input box with suggestions based on last word(tab to append).
## Future Development
* Add basic save/load functionality
* Improve UI (current iteration is purely for testing visuals and functionality)
* Speed up chain generation and improve scraping to get more information and parse out unwanted symbols
* Scale into more fully-fledged editor
